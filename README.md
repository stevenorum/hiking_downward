# hiking_downward
Hiking Upward is currently experiencing difficulties, so here's a script to look through their hikes.

All the GPS files in the "apptrails/" directory were downloaded from http://guymott.com/atgps.html and I strongly encourage you to check out Guy's site to see more information about the process of organizing the data.
Here's an important diclaimer from his page, regarding the GPS data:
```
